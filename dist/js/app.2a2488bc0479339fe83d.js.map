Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info).

Use {@link module:braintree-web/paypal-checkout.create|braintree-web.paypal-checkout.create} instead.</strong>\n *\n * You must have PayPal's checkout.js script loaded on your page to use PayPal Checkout. You can either use the [paypal-checkout package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-checkout) with a build tool or use a script hosted by PayPal:\n *\n * ```html\n * <script src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/api/checkout.js\" data-version-4 log-level=\"warn\"></script>\n * ```\n *\n * Once you have the script loaded, there are two ways to integrate with the checkout.js library.\n *\n * #### Pass a Braintree object into checkout.js\n *\n * You can pass a `braintree` object into PayPal's checkout.js library. This will create the necessary Braintree {@link moudle:braintree-web/client.create|client} and {@link moudle:braintree-web/paypal-checkout.create|PayPal Checkout} components and automatically tokenize the authorized PayPal account.

Use this integration style if you prefer to have some logic between receiving the authorized PayPal account and tokenizing it.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * braintree.client.create({\n *   authorization: 'authorization'\n * }).then(function (clientInstance) {\n *   return braintree.paypalCheckout.create({\n *     client: clientInstance\n *   });\n * }).then(function (paypalCheckoutInstance) {\n *   return paypal.Button.render({\n *     env: 'production', // or 'sandbox'\n *\n *     payment: function () {\n *       return paypalCheckoutInstance.createPayment({\n *         // your createPayment options here\n *       });\n *     },\n *\n *     onAuthorize: function (data, actions) {\n *       // some logic here before tokenization happens below\n *       return paypalCheckoutInstance.tokenizePayment(data).then(function (payload) {\n *         // Submit payload.nonce to your server\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }, '#paypal-button');\n * }).catch(function (err) {\n *  console.error('Error!', err);\n * });\n * ```\n */\nfunction PayPalCheckout(options) {\n  this._client = options.client;\n}\n\n/**\n * Creates a PayPal payment ID or billing token using the given options.
